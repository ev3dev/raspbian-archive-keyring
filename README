README for the raspbian-archive-keyring package
===================================================

The raspbian archive digitally signs its Release files that are
stored on the raspbian.org ftp-sever and its mirrors with the 
keys contained in this package.

Upon installation of this package, the raspbian related keys are
updated using the apt-key command, that is the keys contained in
raspbian-archive-keyring are automatically installed into apt's 
trusted keyring by the package, while the one contained in
raspbian-archive-keyring-removed are automatically removed.

More information about the archive authentication feature can be found
